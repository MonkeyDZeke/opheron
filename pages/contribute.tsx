          <h3>Thank you for joining one of my <i>Pay-What-You-Want</i> Mastermind Groups!</h3>
          <p>
            I believe strongly in giving back to the community, so I initially
            offered my Mastermind groups on The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth
            completely free. But people got so much value from their involvement,
            that I got multiple requests for a way to pay for them!
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, here is now an opportunity for you to contribute to me
            being able to continue offering these powerful Masterminds free of charge.
            If you始re on this page, you始ve already successfully registered, so it始s
            obviously not required to contribute anything. It始s totally up to you.
          </p>

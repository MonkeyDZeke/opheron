                This is what I call the <strong>three-headed hydra of burnout</strong>.
                If you resonate with one or more of these you may be in burnout - or heading for it.

              <ul>
                <li><h6>Destroys job satisfaction and quality of life</h6></li>
                <li><h6>Exacerbates addictive behaviors (like bad spending habits)</h6></li>

                Pause, and think about that. If you are in coding (like most of my clients),
                your ability to troubleshoot, innovate, and work with others are your bread and
                butter. This <i>directly</i> impacts your ability to get out of mid-level
                and into senior-level positions and earnings.

              <p>Greetings friend, my name is Jaymes &ndash; Jaymes with a <i>why.</i> IÊ¼m here to
                help provide you precise clarity on why the change you crave in your life is not
                happening, and then <i>what you can do about it.</i>
              </p>
              <p>As a certified coach I draw from my experience as a successful remote web
                developer, Toastmaster, and addictions recovery facilitator to help you develop
                the underlying relational skills necessary for finding liberty from burnout and
                implementing radical growth. My specialty is in dealing with digital burnout,
                disengagement, and volatile productivity for remote professionals.
              </p>
              <p>We <i>can</i> transcend the obstacles presented by online environments and connect
                authentically!

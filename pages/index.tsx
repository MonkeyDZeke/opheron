          <p><strong>Greetings friend, my name is Jaymes O’Pheron.</strong></p>

          <p>Yep, Jaymes with a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wye" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">wye </a>
            &ndash; or as I like to say &ndash; Jaymes with a why. “Why” is one of my favorite
            questions, and I <i>love</i> to ask questions. It’s kind of my thing, to be honest.
          </p>

          <p>Questions are gateways of opportunity &ndash; portals to universes
            that we can explore and within which we discover solutions and ideas for
            expanding our potential. Questions in conversations with other people are even more
            powerful, as they unlock collaborative genius. Adding structure to those conversations
            can generate yet more value, exponentially catalyzing the existing growth of the
            participants and their solution-discovery process.
          </p>

          <p>Put simply, I am passionate about facilitating conversations which liberate
            people&apos;s full potential.
          </p>

          <p>That can happen through <a href="/faq#coaching">one-on-one coaching sessions</a>, where
            we work together to help you reach your purpose, vision and goals by working through
            programs specific to your needs. Together, we create a strategic, powerful plan for you
            to gain clarity through a regular process including interaction and accountability.
          </p>

          <p>That can also happen through <a href="/faq#mastermind">mastermind group discussions</a>, where
            a select group of people come together with common focus on personal and business
            growth. There is a unique synergy of energy, commitment, and excitement that
            participants bring to a mastermind group. My facilitated groups offer a combination
            of peer brainstorming, education, accountability and support in a group setting,
            discovering value from the diverse perspectives of each individual involved.
          </p>

          <p>Both of these conversation formats are absolutely amazing. I can’t recommend them
            enough. I’ve invested into becoming an independent coach, facilitator, trainer, and
            speaker with certification from <a href="https://johnmaxwellteam.com" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">the John Maxwell Team </a>
            so that I can dedicate my career to adding value to people this way.
          </p>

          <p>I started out as <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@jaymes-opheron" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">a freelance web developer </a>
            and I enjoyed the intellectual challenge, for sure. But as I gained experience,
            I found myself gravitating towards coaching other developers and helping them
            develop their skills more effectively. I particularly found satisfaction in
            leveraging my experience working 100% remotely and my communication expertise
            to help others make authentic connections online, even outside my industry.
          </p>

          <p>Similarly, in my obsession <span className="short">(my wife might say addiction)</span>
            with Toastmasters I’ve found myself gaining more fulfillment and satisfaction from
            coaching other speakers than from doing speeches myself. Despite the fact that I
            <i>love</i> giving speeches.
          </p>

          <p>When I realized that, it clicked for me, and I discovered that while web development
            was <i>what I did</i>, coaching is <i>who I am</i>.
          </p>

          <p>So let me ask you a question.</p>

          <p>How are you doing? <i>Really</i> doing?
            <span className="short">(&lsquo;Fine&rsquo; doesn&apos;t count. In all my experience, I
              have never encountered someone who was purely, truly, just &lsquo;fine.&rsquo;)
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>Do you want to do better?</p>

          <p>Let’s talk about hope, solutions, and your future.</p>

          <p>I’m looking forward to hearing from you. :)</p>

              <p>Greetings friend, my name is Jaymes &ndash; Jaymes with a <i>why.</i> IÊ¼m here to
                help provide you precise clarity on why the change you crave in your life is not
                happening, and then <i>what you can do about it.</i>
              </p>
              <p>As a certified coach I draw from my experience as a successful remote web
                developer, Toastmaster, and addictions recovery facilitator to help you develop
                the underlying relational skills necessary for radical growth. My specialty is
                in dealing with digital burnout, disengagement, and volatile productivity for
                remote professionals.
              </p>
              <p>We <i>can</i> transcend the obstacles presented by online environments and connect
                authentically!
              </p>
